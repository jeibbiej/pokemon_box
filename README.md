Naming icon:

1. Folder names should be divided into generation: g##. If the icon was updated or are different from game to game, include subfolder per game. Use the following game codes:
** g01: re-bl, ye, g02: go-si, cr, g03: ru-sa, em, fr-lg, g04: di-pe, pl, hg-ss, g05: bl-wh, b2-w2, g06: x-y, or-as, g07: su-mo, us-um, g08: sw-sh, dl-ia, dl-ct
2. Gen 1 and 2 should use two digit code (00) for each icon.
3. Gen 3 above should use four digit code (0000) for each icon. This is in preparation (if ever) for four digit National Dex number.
4. For Pokémon with forms, include a base icon. The one with no additional form name.
4.1. Gender form should be added for those with gender difference. Use m or f for male or female, respectively. Use the correct gender for base and add only the 'newly' found gender form. Example: Doduo - 0084, 0084-m, Dodrio - 0085, 0085-f, since Doduo's 'original' form is female and Dodrio's is male.
4.2. Formes (or form), including Mega Evolution (mega), regional variant (alola, galar), Gigantamax (gmax), should be descriptive.
