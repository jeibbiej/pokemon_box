Naming icon:

* Folder names should be divided into generation: g##.
  * If the icon was updated or are different from game to game, include subfolder
    starting with '1'.
  * If an icon is custom, for unavailable icons, use 'custom' as name.
* Gen 1 and 2 should use two digit code (00) for each icon.
* Gen 3 above should use four digit code (0000) for each icon. This is in 
  preparation (if ever) for four digit National Dex number.
* For Pokémon with forms:
  * Have a base icon with no additional name (just numbers).
  * Gender form should be added for those with gender difference. Use m or f for
    male or female, respectively. Use the correct gender for base and add only 
    the 'newly' found gender form. Example: Doduo - 0084, 0084-m, Dodrio - 0085,
    0085-f, since Doduo's 'original' form is female and Dodrio's is male.
  * Formes (or form), including Mega Evolution, Regional variant, and Gigantamax,
    should be descriptive.
  * If form name share same words, it can be removed. Example: Burmy Plant Cloak,
    Sandy Cloak, and Trash Cloak is '0412' (considered as base form), '0412-sandy',
    and '0412-trash'.

Pokémon IDs:
* Pokémon IDs should be a four-digit number following their National Dex number.
* For Pokémon with forms, follow the 'Naming icon' guideline.
