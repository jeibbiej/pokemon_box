/*
National Dex
>>	Sorted by National Number.
>>	If gender difference is available, male should be first before
	female.
>>	If form is available, sort by generation. If the same generation,
	sort by Dex entry of that generation.
Evolution Dex
>>	Gender difference will be included in this list. Minor gender
	difference, like Starly line where the only difference is change 
	in color or parts sizes, should be considered as same entry and 
	be placed next to each other; while major differense, like 
	Frillish line where physically different, should be considerd as
	different entries.
>>  Fossil Pokemon will be considered as same line and should be put 
	after Aerodactyl.
>>	Any related evolutions should be next to each other, like
	Karrablas and Shelmet.
xx	Mega Evolutions will be included in this list but the Pokemon 
	should be holding the Mega Stone to consider it as caught.
>>	Any available form / variant should be included in this list. It
	should follow their release date. If a form creates an evolution
	line, it should be considered as separate entry (Ponyta line and 
	Galarian Ponyta line and not Alolan Raichu).
>>	Pokemon with Gigantamax variants will be included in this list
	but the Pokemon should bear the Gigantamax Gene (logo on the 
	summary). Pokemon with Gigantamax Gene that cannot Gigantamax, 
	like Leon's Charmander -> Charmeleon, should not be included in 
	this list.
